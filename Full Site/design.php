		<h2>The Game Changer</h2>
		<h4>HUMAN-CENTRIC</h4>
		<p>Connectivity and relationships are at the heart of the Home Plate Center campus. Sensitively designed to reflect the landscape and environment, its hospitality-style interiors and welcoming exterior spaces provide places for people to gather, including roof decks with inspiring views of Elliott Bay, Mount Rainier and the Seattle skyline. Retail opportunities in the North Building include a large signature restaurant space, with additional retail space available in the South Building - all adding convenient dining and service amenities to Home Plate Center.</p>
		
		<h4>TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED</h4>
		<p>Every floor is appropriate for office, the most progressive life science and data center use. Fiber and redundant power are ready to meet the needs of todayâ€™s business. Strong post tension reinforced concrete construction offers low vibration and quiet workspace. Designed with flexibility in mind, for an open structure with power and cooling systems readily adaptable for current, future and long term needs.</p>
		
		<h4>BEAUTIFULLY VISIBLE</h4>
		<p>Hundreds of thousands of people frequent the Stadium District for business and entertainment. This opportunity to make countless brand impressions includes available signage and naming rights.  No cookie-cutter development, the differentiating design, inviting public plaza with its kinetic sculpture, seating areas and planned eateries destine the site to become a 'meet me there' Seattle landmark.   </p>

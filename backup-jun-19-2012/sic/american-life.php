		<h2>About American Life</h2>
		
		<p>
		American Life Inc. was established in 1996 to advance the transformation of the area south of downtown (SODO). Because Seattle's geography severely limits available land near downtown, American Life sees a southward trend as inevitable to accommodate the city's historic steady growth patterns. The team is positioning its innovative properties to meet the area's inevitable growth in both importance and value in the mid-to-long term, and is attracting fellow visionaries to join them.
